This is a project on how I made a Artificial Intelligence chatbot (with the help of chat gpt)
first off, you will need the cryptography library:
  pip install cryptography
This will install it.

Then use the server code in the server device and the client code in the client server
How to Run It
Start the server:
python server.py
Start a client in another terminal:
python client.py
now you can chat!
